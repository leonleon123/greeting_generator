I can appreciate coffee without cream, overtime without pay, nights without lights, meals without rice, hamburger without cheese, but never a whole day without greeting you. 
Wish for You Great start for Monday, No obstacles for Tuesday, No stress for Wednesday, No worry for Thursday, Smile for Friday, Party for Saturday, And great fun for Sunday. Have a beautiful and nice week......
Never Try to Go Back And Repair The Past, That Is Impossible, But Be Prepared To Construct The Future Which Is Predictable. . . Have A Splendid Day =)
My Love, I Love My Life Since It Give Me You And I Do Love You Because You Are My Life. If The World Would End Today My Love, I Would Use My Last Gasp Of Breath To Say I Love You Because You Are My Treasure.
No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, and disciplined. But no life is ever happy until it is lived for the glory of God. Keep the faith.
Someday somehow watever you prayed for will COME TRUE... It may not be in the exact pakage you wanted... But... It will be what GOD thinks is best for YOU..
No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, and disciplined. But no life is ever happy until it is lived for the glory of God. Keep the faith.
May you rise each texting day with fully charged cell phone in your hand, inspiring message in your mind, me in your heart, and a clear signal all day long. Nice day
